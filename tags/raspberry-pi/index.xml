      <description>Shirka is a nodejs voice command assistant based in pocketsphinx, living in a RaspberryPi3. Nodered ties all up.
The Ears Shirka_ears listens for voice commands through the microphone, and publishes them in a mosquitto queue. It&amp;rsquo;s based in pocketsphinx, a &amp;ldquo;a lightweight speech recognition engine, specifically tuned for handheld and mobile devices, though it works equally well on the desktop &amp;ldquo;, in their own saying.
The Voice Shirka_voice is a listener to another mosquitto queue that receives the messages, creates a WAF file using pico2wave text-to-speech engine, and reproduces them with omxplayer.</description>
